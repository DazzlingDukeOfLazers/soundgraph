## Drains a feedback outbox to a feedback-service endpoint. Engine-side half of the
## feedback-service envelope, v1.
##
## VENDORED from feedback-service/client/godot/FeedbackSubmitter.gd — the reusable
## asset is the envelope, not the code, so this copy owes that repo nothing but its
## shape. class_name dropped to match this project's preload-consts convention (and
## the import-cache trap that comes with class_name). Update by re-copying.
##
## THE OUTBOX IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH, NOT THIS. Games run offline, on aeroplanes, behind captive
## portals and on machines where the endpoint is simply down. A report that exists only in flight
## is a report that can be lost, so nothing here deletes a line until the server has acknowledged
## it — and a line that is refused as BAD is marked, not silently dropped, because "the server
## rejected all my feedback" should be answerable afterwards.
##
## Drop it in as an autoload, point `outbox_path` at the JSONL the feedback tool writes, and call
## `flush()` whenever you like — app start, a timer, or after a report is filed. Concurrent flushes
## are refused rather than queued: two drains racing over one file is how duplicates are born.

signal finished(sent: int, discarded: int, failed: int)

## No trailing slash. Empty disables submission entirely — the outbox still accumulates, which is
## the correct behaviour for a build that ships before the service exists.

## Make `shot_attached` mean what it says, and return the absolute path of the image to upload ("" if
## there is none). ONE FACT, ONE FIELD: the decision to upload used to read `shot` while the server
## recorded `shot_attached`, so anything that set one without the other made the store lie — 28 of
## the first 38 reports arrived flagged "no screenshot" and then uploaded one, because the migration
## that produced them wrote `shot` and never knew about the flag. The client can lie the other way
## too: Raves sets the flag from its "Include image" checkbox but only writes `shot` if the PNG
## actually saved, so a failed save promised a picture that never existed.
##
## Both directions are settled here rather than upstream because EVERY report passes through this
## function, including ones written by tools that predate the field or by a product that never sets
## it. A missing file demotes the record to "no screenshot" instead of being asserted and then
## silently unfulfilled — a claim nobody can check is worse than a plain no.
