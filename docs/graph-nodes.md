# The Graph Node Pass

Making the graph read as one technical instrument rather than as miniature synth panels.
Built in steps, each rendered and reviewed before the next, the way the cable renderer and
the Add Node browser were. See `docs/cable-design.md` and `docs/add-node-browser.md`.

The rule the whole pass answers to:

> At reduced zoom, remove information before reducing its legibility. Never solve density
> by shrinking meaningful text into noise.

## Step 1 — the baseline

`editor-godot/graph_baseline.gd` takes it. Four zooms, one patch, every measurement
written to a file rather than read off a picture, because "the same patch opens the same
way afterwards" is a claim about numbers:

```
godot --path editor-godot --script graph_baseline.gd     # GRAPH_BASELINE_OUT names the folder
```

First Synth, 1440x900, XL interface, adaptive detail:

```
node   title              size in graph space   ports in/out
n0     Keyboard           479 x 257             1 / 4
n1     Main Oscillator    339 x 211             3 / 1
n2     Filter Sweep       430 x 119             1 / 1
n3     Lowpass            488 x 257             4 / 1
n4     Amp Envelope       388 x 119             1 / 1
n5     Amplifier          225 x 165             2 / 1
n6     Output             392 x 165             2 / 1
```

Seven nodes, seven wires. Widths run from 225 to 488 — every node is as wide as its
contents made it, which is what step 8's width classes are for.

### What each zoom actually shows

```
zoom   detail band   controls drawn   titles cut
100%   FULL          66               0 of 7
 66%   COMPACT       24               0 of 7
 40%   SUMMARY        0               3 of 7
 28%   SUMMARY        0               4 of 7
```

At 40% and 28%: `Main Oscilla…`, `Amp Envelop…`, `Amplifi…`, then `Main Osc…`,
`Filter Swe…`, `Amp Env…`, `Ampl…`. This is the failure the plan names, and it has a
mechanism rather than an accident behind it.

### Where the ellipsis comes from

The editor already has two answers to zoom, and they are not the same thing:

**The detail bands** — `PatchGraph.level_for()`, FULL / COMPACT / SUMMARY / TOPOLOGY at
0.60 and 0.40 with a hysteresis of 0.02. This is already step 12's idea: at 66% the node
sheds parameter rows (66 controls to 24), at 40% it sheds them all. It works.

**The compensated title** — under a screen minimum (`MIN_SCREEN_NODE_TITLE`, 16px before
the UI scale, so 22px at XL) the node's own title Label is hidden and `ScreenText` draws
the name at that pinned size instead, in `node.size.x * zoom - 12` pixels of room, elided
to fit. That is the right instinct — the name stays legible while the node shrinks — with
the wrong last step: when the pinned name does not fit the shrinking node, it is cut.

So the two systems disagree at the bottom. The bands remove information as they should;
the title refuses to, and pays for it in characters. Nothing here is a rendering bug, and
nothing is fixed by a smaller font: at 28% the Amplifier node is 63 screen pixels wide and
its name at the legibility floor wants 96.

That is the finding step 12 has to answer, and the shape of the answer is in the plan
already: **an intentional short name, not an ellipsis.**

### Two other things the baseline turned up

The lens switch floats over the canvas at the top right, so nodes scroll underneath it —
at 40% the Output node sits behind `Graph | Schematic`. It is a chrome question rather
than a node one, and it is recorded here because a screenshot of the graph at low zoom
will keep showing it.

`Design.MIN_SCREEN_*` rises with the interface scale, so an XL reader reaches every band
sooner and hits the elision earlier. Anything measured in this pass is measured at XL,
which is the tightest case.

### What may not change

Pinned in `editor_test.gd`: First Synth is those seven nodes with those port counts, and
the document holds seven wires. Surfaces, type, icons and what survives a zoom are all in
scope; what the patch *is* is not, and the way that goes wrong is a port quietly gained or
lost while somebody is looking at the colours.
